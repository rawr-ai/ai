"""Light-weight smoke tests for the rawr CLI.

This module purposefully contains only a *very* small set of assertions that
run quickly. The goal is to ensure that the command-line entry-point can be
imported and that the global ``--help`` flag works. More granular tests will be
re-added once the CLI stabilises.
