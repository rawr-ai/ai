### CLI to YAML Migration

Goal: Migrate all agent prompts to a new agnostic YAML config format.

Why: A standard YAML format will be easier to manage for the CLI, agents, and developers. Also allows for more complex prompt configurations, extensions, and easier management of agent settings.

Secondary goal: Use this YAML format as the basis for mcparty.ai MCP server.
