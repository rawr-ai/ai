### Supports
- [ ] Role
  - [ ] `Raw` (optional, raw text instructions for the agent)
  - [ ] Core Identity & Purpose
  - [ ] Expertise
  - [ ] Core Mandate
- [ ] Behavior
  - [ ] `Raw` (optional, raw text instructions for the agent)
  - [ ] SOPs (standard operating procedures)
  - [ ] Authorizations
    - [ ] `authorized`
    - [ ] `unauthorized`
  - [ ] Boundaries (what this agent should not focus on or pay attention to)
    - [ ] `handoff` instructions on what to do if this agent can't handle a task, or if it can handle but the best way to do it is to hand it off to another agent
- [ ] `type` (type of agent); one of:
  - [ ] `generalist` (general-purpose agent)
  - [ ] `utility` (general-purpose agent)
  - [ ] `orchestrator` (orchestrates other agents)
  - [ ] `specialist` (specializes in a specific task or domain)
- [ ] `context` (references to files, directories, etc. that are relevant to the agent)
  - [ ] `local` (local files, directories, etc. in the project)
  - [ ] `remote` (hosted files, directories, that can be found via MCP tools -- browser, filesystem, etc.)
  - [ ] `memory` (memory bank or other similar system for storing agent-specific information over time; basic RAG usually)
  - [ ] `graph` (graph database or other similar system for storing semantic relationships between concepts and entities over time that aid in reasoning, planning, understanding, and decision-making)
- [ ] `tools` (granular, custom mcp tool permissions)
  - [ ] `native` (native tool permissions === `groups` right now in roo)
  - [ ] `custom` (custom tool permissions; allows import, inherit/extend, or inline definition of tools)
- [ ] `workflows` (optional, for custom workflow definitions)
  - [ ] `gameplans` (highest level workflow; orchestrates other workflows by invoking orchestrator agents to complete large projects)
  - [ ] `playbooks` (playbooks are collections of multi-agent workflows that can be invoked by orchestrator agents to complete larger objectives -- they CANNOT be invoked directly by other agents)
  - [ ] `routes` (routes are single-agent workflows invoked directly by the agent itself; they are typically used for multi-step tasks that should **not** create subtasks but may invoke other agents via `switch_mode`). These are effectively codified SOPs.
- [ ] `team` 
  - [ ] `partners` (peer-level agents with which this mode **collaborates**, not delegates)
  - [ ] `subordinates` (agents to which this mode **delegates** work and **coordinates**, and which report to this mode)
  - [ ] `superiors` (agents to which this mode **reports** -- superiors can override the default behavior of this mode)
- [ ] `api` (optional, for custom API endpoints)
  - [ ] `model` (required, model to use for the API call)
  - [ ] `url` (required, URL of the API endpoint)
