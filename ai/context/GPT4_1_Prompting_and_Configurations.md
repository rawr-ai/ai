# GPT-4.1 Model Classes Overview

- **Regular GPT-4.1**:  
  The flagship model optimized for complex tasks. It supports a 1-million-token context window, delivers the highest accuracy, and incurs higher cost. Ideal for applications requiring deep understanding and extensive context.

- **GPT-4.1 Mini**:  
  Balanced for intelligence, speed, and cost. It is faster and more efficient than the regular model but with some tradeoffs in accuracy. Suitable for use cases needing a good compromise between performance and resource consumption.

- **GPT-4.1 Nano**:  
  The fastest and most cost-effective variant. It has the lowest accuracy but is suitable for cost-sensitive or speed-critical tasks where simpler instructions suffice.

# Strengths and Weaknesses by Model Class

- **Regular GPT-4.1**:  
  - Strengths: Best overall performance, strong instruction following, excellent long context handling.  
  - Weaknesses: Higher latency and cost compared to smaller variants.

- **GPT-4.1 Mini**:  
  - Strengths: Good balance of speed, cost, and intelligence; faster response times; lower cost.  
  - Weaknesses: Some accuracy and reliability tradeoffs compared to the regular model.

- **GPT-4.1 Nano**:  
  - Strengths: Very fast and cheap; ideal for simpler tasks and high-throughput scenarios.  
  - Weaknesses: Less reliable on complex instructions and nuanced tasks; lower accuracy.

# Unique Prompting Strategies for GPT-4.1

- **System Prompt Reminders**:  
  Use persistent system prompts to reinforce agentic workflows, including tool-calling and optional planning steps to improve reasoning and task execution.

- **Tool Calls via API**:  
  Prefer using the `tools` field in the API for invoking external tools rather than manual prompt injection. This approach improves reliability and clarity in multi-step workflows.

- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**:  
  Encourage explicit step-by-step reasoning in prompts to enhance output quality and reduce errors.

- **Long Context Handling**:  
  Place critical instructions both at the beginning and end of the context window to leverage the 1-million-token capacity effectively.

- **Instruction Following**:  
  GPT-4.1 models are more literal and steerable than predecessors. Use explicit, clear, and unambiguous instructions to get the best results.

# Model Configuration Parameters (top-p, top-k, temperature)

- OpenAI recommends adjusting either **temperature** or **top-p**, but **not both simultaneously**.

- The **top-k** parameter is **not exposed** in the API for GPT-4.1 models.

- Typical default values:  
  ```  
  temperature: 0.7  
  top-p: 0.9  
  ```  
  Adjust these based on the desired randomness and creativity.

- Lower temperature or top-p values yield more deterministic and focused outputs; higher values increase diversity and creativity.

# Practical Advice

- Build informative evaluation sets and iterate on prompts to optimize for your specific use case.

- Use explicit and clear instructions to leverage GPT-4.1â€™s literal interpretation capabilities.

- Consider cost-performance tradeoffs carefully when choosing between regular, mini, and nano models to balance accuracy, speed, and expense.
