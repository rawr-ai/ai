# Review Feedback: pb_create_new_agent_draft.md

**Overall Assessment:**

The draft playbook `pb_create_new_agent_draft.md` is generally well-structured, clear, and accurately reflects the agent creation process outlined in the analysis summary and process diagram. It correctly references key conventions and tools. However, **revisions are required** to address one major inconsistency regarding agent slug derivation and a few minor points for improved clarity and precision before approval.

**Positive Feedback:**

*   The playbook clearly defines the purpose and objective.
*   The roles involved in the core creation process are accurately identified and described consistently with the broader organizational context.
*   The workflow steps presented in the table format are clear, logical, and align well with the sequence diagram (`agent_creation_process.mermaid`) and the analysis summary.
*   Inputs, outputs, and key artifacts are correctly summarized.
*   References to convention documents (`agent_config_conventions.md`, `official_roo-custom-modes.md`) are appropriate.
*   The description of the Agent Configuration Management Script's purpose and key commands (`add`, `update`, `delete`, `sync`) aligns with the conventions document and the available script code (`commands.py`).

**Issues Found:**

**Major Issues (Require Revision):**

1.  **Inconsistent Slug Derivation:**
    *   **Location:** Playbook @LINE:51
    *   **Description:** The playbook states the Markdown naming convention is `agent_<slug>.md`. However, the referenced `agent_config_conventions.md` (@LINE:25) explicitly states the `slug` is derived from the **parent directory name**, not the filename itself (e.g., for `agents/diagram/agent_diagram.md`, the slug is `diagram`). This creates a contradiction.
    *   **Rationale:** Consistency between the playbook and the core convention document is crucial to avoid confusion during implementation. The script relies on deriving the slug from the directory.
    *   **Recommendation:** Revise Line 51 to accurately reflect that the `slug` is derived from the parent directory name, as defined in `agent_config_conventions.md`. Clarify the relationship between the directory name (source of slug) and the typical filename pattern (which might be `agent_definition.md`, `agent_<slug>.md`, or similar, but isn't the source of the slug itself). Suggestion: "Naming: Typically `agent_definition.md` or similar within a directory named after the slug (e.g., `ai/agents/diagram/agent_definition.md` yields slug `diagram`)."

**Minor Issues (Recommended Improvements):**

1.  **JSON File Path Specificity:**
    *   **Location:** Playbook @LINE:54
    *   **Description:** The playbook gives `ai/graph/plays/custom_modes.json` as the example central file location, matching `agent_config_conventions.md`. The official Roo Code docs (`official_roo-custom-modes.md`) refer to it more generically as the global `custom_modes.json`.
    *   **Rationale:** While consistent with one source, acknowledging the potential variability or referencing the official generic name could prevent confusion if the exact path differs in practice.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider adding a brief note acknowledging this is the conventional path within this project context, or simply reference the "global `custom_modes.json`" as per official docs alongside the project-specific `.roomodes`.

2.  **Script Location Detail:**
    *   **Location:** Playbook @LINE:63
    *   **Description:** The playbook correctly identifies the script directory as `scripts/agent_config_manager/`. The `agent_config_conventions.md` document mentioned a specific (though slightly different) script name (`manage_agent_configs.py`).
    *   **Rationale:** While the directory is correct, mentioning the expected entry point script name (if standardized, e.g., `main.py` or `cli.py` within that directory) could add a minor bit of clarity for the Roster Manager. However, leaving it as the directory is also acceptable.
    *   **Recommendation:** (Optional) If a standard entry point script exists within the directory (e.g., `main.py`), consider mentioning it (e.g., "Location: `scripts/agent_config_manager/` (e.g., executed via `main.py`)"). Otherwise, leave as is.

**Nitpicks/Style:**

1.  **Role Naming:**
    *   **Location:** Playbook @LINE:9
    *   **Description:** The role "User/Initiator" is used.
    *   **Rationale:** While accurate, "Initiator" alone might be slightly cleaner and sufficient, as "User" is often implied in such contexts.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider simplifying to just "Initiator".

**Assumptions/Questions:**

*   Assumed the `sync` command mentioned in the playbook and conventions, although not present in the provided `commands.py` snippet, is either implemented elsewhere in the script module or handled by a wrapper CLI. The playbook's description based on the convention is deemed acceptable under this assumption.
