**Overall Assessment:**

Playbook approved. All revisions requested in the previous feedback (`review_feedback.md`) have been successfully addressed in the current version of `pb_create_new_agent_draft.md`.

**Verification Details:**

*   **Major Issue (Slug Derivation):** Corrected at Line 51 to accurately state the slug derives from the directory name.
*   **Minor Issue (JSON Path Specificity):** Clarified at Line 54 with "(project-specific path)" and mention of `.roomodes`.
*   **Minor Issue (Script Location Detail):** No change made, which is acceptable per the optional recommendation.
*   **Nitpick (Role Naming):** Simplified to "Initiator" at Line 9.

The playbook is now deemed clear, accurate, and consistent with the required conventions and process. No further revisions are required based on the previous feedback cycle.
