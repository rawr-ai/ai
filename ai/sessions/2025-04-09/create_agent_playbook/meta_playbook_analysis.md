# Meta-Playbook Analysis: Workflow for Creating `pb_create_new_agent.md`

This document analyzes and abstracts the workflow followed during the conversation (Session: 2025-04-09) to generate the `pb_create_new_agent.md` playbook.

## Objective

To create a formal playbook documenting the process for generating new agents/custom modes, based on existing project context, conventions, and tools.

## Workflow Stages & Agents Used

1.  **Objective Definition & Initial Planning (`command` mode):**
    *   **Input:** User request to create a playbook for agent generation, referencing relevant context paths.
    *   **Action:** The Orchestrator agent analyzed the request, consulted its internal knowledge (SOPs, available playbooks), designed a multi-step workflow leveraging different agent modes (`analyze`, `diagram`, `document`, `review`, `code`), and presented the plan.
    *   **Output:** A structured workflow plan and initiation of the first step (`analyze`) via `new_task`.

2.  **Discovery & Analysis (`analyze` mode):**
    *   **Input:** Workflow plan instructions, paths to context files (`ai/context/*`, `scripts/agent_config_manager/commands.py`, `ai/agents`, `ai/playbooks`, `ai/docs/orchestrator_SOPs.md`).
    *   **Action:** Read and synthesized information from the specified sources to understand and document the *current* implicit/explicit process for creating a new agent (steps, conventions, tools, roles).
    *   **Output:** A structured summary document: `ai/sessions/2025-04-09/create_agent_playbook/analysis_summary.md`.

3.  **Process Visualization (`diagram` mode):**
    *   **Input:** `analysis_summary.md`.
    *   **Action:** Generated a Mermaid sequence diagram visualizing the agent creation process described in the analysis summary.
    *   **Output:** Mermaid diagram file: `ai/sessions/2025-04-09/create_agent_playbook/agent_creation_process.mermaid`. (Note: This step required a retry due to an initial interruption).

4.  **Playbook Drafting (`document` mode):**
    *   **Input:** `analysis_summary.md`, `agent_creation_process.mermaid`.
    *   **Action:** Drafted the formal `pb_create_new_agent.md` playbook based on the structured analysis and visual diagram.
    *   **Output:** Draft playbook file: `ai/sessions/2025-04-09/create_agent_playbook/pb_create_new_agent_draft.md`.

5.  **Iterative Review & Refinement Loop (`review` -> `document` modes):**
    *   **5a. First Review (`review` mode):**
        *   **Input:** Draft playbook, analysis summary, diagram, context references.
        *   **Action:** Reviewed the draft for accuracy, completeness, consistency, and clarity. Identified issues (major inconsistency in slug derivation, minor points).
        *   **Output:** Feedback indicating revisions were required (initially intended for `review_feedback.md`, but content was provided via user interaction after mode limitations were encountered).
    *   **5b. Revision (`document` mode):**
        *   **Input:** Draft playbook, review feedback (provided via orchestrator instructions).
        *   **Action:** Applied the specified revisions to the draft playbook.
        *   **Output:** Revised draft playbook (overwriting `pb_create_new_agent_draft.md`).
    *   **5c. Second Review (`review` mode):**
        *   **Input:** Revised draft playbook, previous feedback (`review_feedback.md`), context references.
        *   **Action:** Verified that all previous feedback was addressed correctly. Confirmed approval.
        *   **Output:** Final review report confirming approval: `ai/sessions/2025-04-09/create_agent_playbook/review_feedback_round2.md`.

6.  **Playbook Finalization (within Session Dir) (`code` mode):**
    *   **Input:** Approved draft playbook path, final playbook path (within session dir).
    *   **Action:** Copied the content of the approved draft to the final filename.
    *   **Output:** Final playbook file within the session directory: `ai/sessions/2025-04-09/create_agent_playbook/pb_create_new_agent.md`.

7.  **Post-Creation Integration & Refinement (User Prompted):**
    *   **7a. Diagram Sync Check (`diagram` mode):**
        *   **Input:** Final playbook, diagram file.
        *   **Action:** Reviewed the diagram against the *final* playbook content to ensure consistency. No updates were needed.
        *   **Output:** Confirmation that the diagram was accurate.
    *   **7b. Diagram Embedding (`code` mode):**
        *   **Input:** Diagram file, final playbook file.
        *   **Action:** Read the diagram content and embedded it within the final playbook using a Mermaid code block.
        *   **Output:** Updated final playbook with embedded diagram: `ai/sessions/2025-04-09/create_agent_playbook/pb_create_new_agent.md`.
    *   **7c. Playbook Relocation (`code` mode):**
        *   **Input:** Final playbook path (session dir), target playbook path (`ai/playbooks/`).
        *   **Action:** Copied the playbook content to the main `ai/playbooks/` directory.
        *   **Output:** Playbook file created at `ai/playbooks/pb_create_new_agent.md`.
    *   **7d. Registry Update (`code` mode):**
        *   **Input:** Registry path (`ai/playbooks/pb_registry.md`), new playbook details.
        *   **Action:** Added an entry for the new playbook to the registry file.
        *   **Output:** Updated registry file: `ai/playbooks/pb_registry.md`.

## Key Patterns Observed

*   **Orchestration:** The `command` mode acted as the central orchestrator, planning the workflow and dispatching tasks to specialized agents.
*   **Discovery-Driven:** The process started with analysis (`analyze`) to understand the existing state before defining the target artifact (playbook).
*   **Iterative Verification:** A review loop (`review` -> `document`) was crucial for ensuring the quality and accuracy of the drafted playbook.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Different agents handled distinct tasks (analysis, diagramming, drafting, review, file operations).
*   **SOP Adherence:** The inclusion of a diagramming step followed the "Specify Before Execution" principle from the Orchestrator SOPs.
*   **Explicit Finalization:** Separate steps were needed to move the final artifact to its canonical location and update relevant registries.
