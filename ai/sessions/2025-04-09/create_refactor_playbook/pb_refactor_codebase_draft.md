# Technical Outline for Generic Codebase Refactoring Workflow

This document outlines the technical steps, considerations, and common practices involved in a generic codebase refactoring workflow. It serves as a technical foundation for building a detailed playbook.

## 1. Investigation Phase

**Goal:** Understand the current state of the codebase, identify areas needing improvement, and gather data to inform the refactoring strategy.

**Technical Activities:**

*   **Static Code Analysis:**
    *   Run linters (e.g., ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop, Checkstyle) to identify style violations and potential errors.
    *   Use complexity analysis tools (e.g., Radon, PMD CPD/Cyclomatic Complexity, SonarQube) to find complex methods/classes (high cyclomatic complexity, low maintainability index).
    *   Employ static analysis security testing (SAST) tools if security improvements are a goal.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**
    *   Map internal and external dependencies (e.g., using `npm list --depth=1`, `pipdeptree`, `mvn dependency:tree`, IDE features). Understand coupling between modules.
    *   Identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Code Exploration & Pattern Searching:**
    *   Use code search tools (IDE search, `grep`, `ack`, `ag`, `search_files` tool) to find specific anti-patterns (e.g., God classes, feature envy, duplicated code blocks).
    *   Manually review key areas identified by analysis tools or known hotspots.
    *   Utilize `list_code_definition_names` to understand the structure and components within specific modules or directories.
    *   Use `read_file` to examine specific code sections in detail.
*   **Architecture/Design Understanding:**
    *   Review existing architecture diagrams, READMEs, and design documents.
    *   Trace key data flows or request lifecycles through the code.
    *   Identify major components, layers, and their interactions.
*   **Version Control History Analysis:**
    *   Examine `git log` and `git blame` for files/modules with high churn, which often indicate problematic areas or technical debt accumulation.

**Considerations:**

*   Tooling availability and configuration for the specific language/stack.
*   Scope of investigation (whole codebase vs. specific modules).
*   Integrating findings from multiple tools.

## 2. Analysis & Documentation Phase

**Goal:** Synthesize investigation findings into actionable insights and document the "why" and "what" of the proposed refactoring.

**Technical Activities:**

*   **Correlate Findings:** Link static analysis results, dependency issues, and identified patterns to specific code locations and potential refactoring goals (e.g., improve readability, reduce coupling, enhance performance).
*   **Quantify Issues:** Assign metrics where possible (e.g., complexity scores before/after, number of lint errors, test coverage percentage).
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine the underlying reasons for the identified issues (e.g., lack of clear design, copy-paste coding, evolving requirements).
*   **Visualize Structure:** Create diagrams (e.g., using Mermaid, PlantUML, or specialized tools) to illustrate current problematic structures and potentially the target state.

**Artifacts:**

*   **Technical Analysis Report (`analysis.md`):** Summarizes findings, lists identified code smells/anti-patterns with locations, includes relevant metrics, highlights high-priority areas.
*   **Diagrams:** Component diagrams, dependency graphs, sequence diagrams illustrating problematic interactions.
*   **Refactoring Candidates List:** A prioritized list of specific classes, methods, or modules identified for refactoring, along with the reasons.

## 3. Planning Phase

**Goal:** Define a clear, actionable plan for executing the refactoring, including scope, steps, risks, and validation criteria.

**Technical Elements:**

*   **Define Scope & Goals:** Clearly state the boundaries of the refactoring effort and the specific technical objectives (e.g., "Apply Strategy pattern to `PaymentProcessor` class to simplify conditional logic," "Reduce cyclomatic complexity of `calculate_report` below 10," "Decouple `UserService` from `NotificationService`").
*   **Identify Specific Code Sections:** Pinpoint the exact files, classes, and methods to be modified.
*   **Define Target State:** Describe the desired code structure, design pattern, or metric improvement after refactoring. Include code snippets or diagrams if helpful.
*   **Sequence Changes:** Break down large refactorings into smaller, logical steps. Define the order of operations, considering dependencies between changes.
*   **Select Refactoring Techniques:** Specify the refactoring patterns to be applied (e.g., Extract Method, Move Field, Replace Inheritance with Delegation, Introduce Facade).
*   **Risk Assessment:** Identify potential risks (e.g., breaking existing functionality, performance degradation, merge conflicts) and define mitigation strategies (e.g., enhanced testing, feature flags, smaller steps).
*   **Rollback Strategy:** Define how to revert changes if significant issues arise.
*   **Validation Criteria:** Specify how success will be measured (e.g., tests passing, complexity metrics improved, code review approval).

**Artifacts:**

*   **Refactoring Plan (`refactor_plan.md`):** A detailed document containing all the elements above.

## 4. Testing Strategy Phase

**Goal:** Ensure that refactoring does not introduce regressions and that the behavior of the code remains consistent or improves as intended.

**Common Approaches:**

*   **Assess Existing Coverage:** Use code coverage tools (e.g., `pytest-cov`, JaCoCo, Istanbul) to measure test coverage in the areas targeted for refactoring.
*   **Characterization Tests:** If coverage is low or confidence in existing tests is weak, write tests that capture the current observable behavior of the code *before* refactoring. These act as a safety net.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** For significant modifications or new logic introduced during refactoring, write tests *first* that define the expected behavior.
*   **Unit Tests:** Focus on testing individual components in isolation. Refactoring often involves improving unit testability.
*   **Integration Tests:** Verify the interactions between refactored components and their collaborators. Run these frequently.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Validate critical user workflows or API endpoints remain functional.
*   **Performance Tests:** If performance is a concern or goal, establish baseline performance metrics and re-run tests after refactoring.
*   **Manual Testing:** Define specific scenarios for manual validation if automated tests are insufficient or impractical for certain aspects.

**Influence on Plan:**

*   The testing strategy heavily influences the granularity and sequencing of refactoring steps. Areas with poor test coverage may require writing characterization tests *before* refactoring begins, adding to the overall effort.
*   High-risk refactorings demand more comprehensive testing strategies.
*   The plan must allocate time for writing, updating, and running tests.

## 5. Implementation Preparation Phase

**Goal:** Set up the technical environment and prerequisites for performing the refactoring work safely and efficiently.

**Technical Setup:**

*   **Version Control (Git):**
    *   Ensure the local repository is up-to-date with the target baseline (e.g., `git pull origin main`).
    *   Create a dedicated feature branch based on the agreed naming convention (e.g., `git checkout -b refactor/payment-processor-strategy` from `main`). Refer to `ai/context/orchestrator_SOPs.md` for specific branching strategies.
    *   Verify the baseline branch is clean (all tests pass, no linting errors).
*   **Tooling:**
    *   Configure IDEs with relevant plugins for refactoring, linting, and testing.
    *   Ensure build tools, dependency managers, and test runners are correctly set up and functional.
    *   Set up any specialized analysis or refactoring tools if needed.
*   **Environment:**
    *   Ensure a stable local development environment that mirrors production as closely as feasible.

## 6. Cleanup Phase

**Goal:** Remove remnants of the old implementation, ensure consistency, and update related artifacts after the core refactoring is complete and validated.

**Technical Tasks:**

*   **Remove Dead Code:** Use static analysis tools or manual review to identify and remove unused variables, imports, methods, classes, or configuration left over from the old implementation.
*   **Code Formatting & Linting:** Run code formatters (e.g., Prettier, Black, gofmt) and linters across all changed files to ensure consistency with project standards.
*   **Update Documentation:**
    *   Modify code comments (docstrings, inline comments) to accurately reflect the new structure and logic.
    *   Update relevant README files, architecture documents, or developer guides.
*   **Dependency Cleanup:** Remove any dependencies that are no longer needed after the refactoring.
*   **Remove Temporary Artifacts:** Delete any temporary scripts, configuration files, or scaffolding used specifically during the refactoring process.

## 7. Git Integration Points

**Goal:** Leverage Git effectively throughout the workflow for safety, collaboration, and traceability, adhering to established SOPs (e.g., `ai/context/orchestrator_SOPs.md`).

**Key Integration Points:**

1.  **Investigation:** Use `git log`, `git blame` to understand code history and identify hotspots.
2.  **Preparation:** Create a dedicated feature branch (`git checkout -b ...`) from a stable baseline before starting any changes.
3.  **Implementation:**
    *   Make small, atomic commits (`git commit -m "Refactor: ..."`) frequently after each logical step or passing test run. Write clear, concise commit messages explaining the *what* and *why* of the change.
    *   Run tests *before* each commit to ensure the branch remains in a working state.
    *   Push the branch regularly (`git push origin <branch-name>`) to back up work and enable potential collaboration/early feedback.
4.  **Cleanup:** Perform cleanup tasks in separate, clearly marked commits on the feature branch.
5.  **Merging:**
    *   Ensure the feature branch is up-to-date with the target branch (`git pull origin <target-branch>`) and resolve any conflicts locally.
    *   Ensure all tests pass and code meets quality standards.
    *   Initiate the merge process (e.g., create a Pull Request/Merge Request).
    *   Address code review feedback via additional commits on the branch.
    *   Merge the branch using the project's agreed strategy (merge commit, squash, rebase) once approved.
6.  **Rollback:** Git provides mechanisms for reverting changes if necessary (e.g., `git revert`, `git reset`), although careful planning and testing aim to avoid this.
