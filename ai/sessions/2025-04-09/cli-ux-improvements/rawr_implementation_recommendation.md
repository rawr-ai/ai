# Recommendation: Implementing the `rawr` Command Alias

## 1. Goal

To enable invoking the existing `typer`-based CLI application (defined in `cli/main.py`) via a single command alias, `rawr`, after installation.

## 2. Analysis of Packaging Options

Several standard Python methods exist for creating command-line entry points:

*   **`setup.py` (Legacy Setuptools):** Uses the `entry_points` argument within the `setup()` function. While functional, `setup.py` is being superseded by `pyproject.toml` for defining package metadata and build configurations.
*   **`pyproject.toml` with Setuptools Backend:** Defines entry points declaratively in the `[project.scripts]` table (PEP 621). This is the modern standard when using `setuptools` as the build system. It coexists well with `requirements.txt`.
*   **`pyproject.toml` with Poetry:** Defines scripts in `[tool.poetry.scripts]`. Poetry is a full dependency management and packaging tool. While powerful, adopting it would be a larger change than just adding an entry point.
*   **`pyproject.toml` with Flit:** Defines scripts in `[project.scripts]`. Flit is another modern build backend, often favored for simpler, pure-Python packages.

## 3. Recommendation

**Use `pyproject.toml` with the `setuptools` build backend.**

**Justification:**

*   **Modern Standard:** Aligns with current Python packaging best practices (PEP 517, PEP 518, PEP 621).
*   **Simplicity:** It's a declarative and relatively simple way to define the entry point.
*   **Compatibility:** Integrates smoothly with the existing use of `requirements.txt` for dependency management. It doesn't require migrating to a different dependency tool like Poetry immediately.
*   **Future-Proof:** Provides a solid foundation if more advanced packaging features or a switch to a different backend (like Poetry) is desired later.

## 4. Implementation Steps

1.  **Create `pyproject.toml`:** Add a file named `pyproject.toml` to the project root directory (`/Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/ai`).
2.  **Add Content:** Populate `pyproject.toml` with the following content:

    ```toml
    [build-system]
    requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"] # Specify setuptools build backend
    build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

    [project]
    name = "ai-cli-tool" # Replace with a suitable package name
    version = "0.1.0"    # Initial version
    description = "CLI tool for managing AI agent configurations." # Add a brief description
    requires-python = ">=3.8" # Specify Python version compatibility
    # Add other metadata like authors, license, readme, etc. as needed
    # Dependencies can be listed here or kept in requirements.txt
    # If kept in requirements.txt, ensure build process includes them.

    [project.scripts]
    # This line defines the command alias 'rawr'
    # It points to the 'app' object (the typer application)
    # within the 'cli.main' module.
    rawr = "cli.main:app"
    ```

3.  **Installation:** To make the `rawr` command available in the environment, the package needs to be installed. For development, use an editable install from the project root:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    This command tells `pip` to use the `pyproject.toml` file, invoke the `setuptools` build backend, and create the necessary entry point script (`rawr`) linked to the source code.

## 5. Trade-offs

*   **Introduces Build System:** Adds `setuptools` as a build dependency if it wasn't explicitly one before (though it's often present).
*   **Requires Installation Step:** The `rawr` command only becomes available *after* the package is installed via `pip`. It doesn't automatically work just by having the source code.

## 6. Next Steps

*   Create the `pyproject.toml` file with the specified content.
*   Run `pip install -e .` in the development environment to test the `rawr` command.
