# Draft Requirements: "Edit" Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the initial understanding and clarifying questions for the development of a new "Edit" agent. The primary goal of this agent is to apply edits requested by other models/agents, adhering strictly to specified conventions and processes. This agent will function as a specialized implementation tool within a larger agent workflow.

**Note:** This draft is based solely on the initial task description. Referenced SOPs, agent creation playbooks, and specific model configuration guidance were not provided and should be consulted for a complete requirements definition.

## 2. Understood Requirements (Based on Task Description)

*   **Core Function:** Apply edits to files as directed by other agents/models.
*   **Exclusivity:** The agent's *sole* purpose is applying edits; it should not perform analysis, planning, or other tasks.
*   **Process Adherence:** Must follow all relevant conventions and process requirements (details TBD from SOPs/playbooks).
*   **Tooling:** Will likely utilize file manipulation tools (e.g., `apply_diff`, `insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, `write_to_file`) but *not* the capabilities of a full "CODE" agent (implying no code generation or complex reasoning beyond applying the specified edit).
*   **Target Environment:** Operates within the established agent framework and session structure (e.g., writing artifacts to session directories).

## 3. Clarifying Questions

To refine the requirements for the "Edit" agent, the following information is needed:

### 3.1. Scope of Edits:
    *   What specific types of edits will this agent handle? (e.g., line replacements, insertions, deletions, search/replace, full file overwrites?)
    *   Will edits be provided as diffs, specific line/content instructions, or another format?
    *   What file types/formats must the agent support? (e.g., `.md`, `.py`, `.js`, `.json`, `.yaml`, configuration files?)
    *   Is there a maximum file size or complexity the agent should handle?
    *   How should the agent handle edit conflicts if the target file has changed since the edit was requested?

### 3.2. Triggers & Integration:
    *   How will other agents/models trigger the "Edit" agent? (e.g., direct API call, message queue, specific tool invocation?)
    *   What is the expected input format for an edit request? (Please provide a schema or examples).
    *   What information should the "Edit" agent return upon success or failure? (e.g., confirmation, diff of changes, error message?)

### 3.3. Restrictions & Constraints:
    *   Are there specific directories or file patterns the agent is *forbidden* from editing?
    *   Are there specific operations (e.g., deleting files, executing commands) the agent should *never* perform, even if requested?
    *   What are the security considerations? How will permissions be managed?
    *   Are there performance requirements (e.g., maximum time per edit)?
    *   Does the agent need to maintain idempotency (applying the same edit request multiple times yields the same result)?

### 3.4. Conventions & Processes:
    *   Where can the specific SOPs and playbooks governing agent creation and operation be found?
    *   What are the logging/auditing requirements for edits applied by this agent?
    *   Are there specific error handling procedures to follow?

### 3.5. Model Configuration:
    *   Where is the "GPT-4.1 nano configuration guidance" located?
    *   Does the choice of model imply specific capabilities or limitations for applying edits (e.g., context window size affecting diff application)?

## 4. Next Steps

*   Gather answers to the clarifying questions above.
*   Consult the referenced SOPs, playbooks, and configuration guidance.
*   Refine this document into a formal requirements specification.
