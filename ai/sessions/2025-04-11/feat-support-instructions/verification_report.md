# Verification Report: `customInstructions` Field Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-11

## Overall Assessment

Verification **Passed**. The implementation of the `customInstructions` field in `cli/models.py` aligns with the specification (`ai/sessions/2025-04-11/feat-support-instructions/implementation_spec.md`), and the assessment that no changes were required in `cli/compiler.py` is correct.

## Positive Feedback

*   The `customInstructions` field was added to `cli/models.py` exactly as specified, using correct Pydantic typing (`Optional[str]`) and configuration (`Field(None, ...)`).
*   The rationale provided by the `implement` agent regarding `cli/compiler.py` was accurate and confirmed by code review. The explicit `include` set in the `model_dump` call effectively prevents the new field from impacting the registry metadata extraction.

## Issues Found

*   **None.**

## Verification Details

### 1. `cli/models.py` Review

*   **File:** `cli/models.py`
*   **Finding:** The `GlobalAgentConfig` model correctly includes the field `customInstructions: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Optional user-defined instructions for the agent.")` at line 31.
*   **Conclusion:** This implementation matches the requirements defined in `implementation_spec.md`.

### 2. `cli/compiler.py` Assessment Verification

*   **File:** `cli/compiler.py`
*   **Finding:** The `extract_registry_metadata` function uses `config.model_dump` with an explicit `include` set: `{'slug', 'name', 'roleDefinition', 'groups', 'apiConfiguration'}` (lines 13-17). The `customInstructions` field is correctly excluded from this set.
*   **Conclusion:** The assessment that no changes were needed in `cli/compiler.py` because the new field is not included in the data extracted for the registry is **correct**. The existing code structure prevents unintended side effects from the added field in this specific context.

## Assumptions/Questions

*   None.
