# Test Discovery Report for cli/models.py Changes

Based on a scan of the repository structure, the following test files are potentially relevant to the recent changes in `cli/models.py`:

## Potentially Relevant Test Files

*   `tests/unit/test_models.py` (Most likely affected)
*   `tests/unit/test_compiler.py` (Potentially affected due to model usage in compilation)
*   `tests/integration/test_compile_command.py` (Potentially affected if model changes impact the compile command)
*   Other files in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` might require review depending on the exact nature of the model changes.

## Test Execution Command

The presence of `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml`, and `tests/conftest.py` strongly indicates that `pytest` is used as the test runner.

Likely commands to execute tests:

1.  **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
2.  **Run specific relevant tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest tests/unit/test_models.py tests/unit/test_compiler.py tests/integration/test_compile_command.py
    ```
3.  **Run all tests within the `tests` directory:**
    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```

Recommendation: Start by running `pytest tests/unit/test_models.py` and `pytest tests/unit/test_compiler.py`. If those pass, consider running the full suite (`pytest`) to catch any indirect breakages.
