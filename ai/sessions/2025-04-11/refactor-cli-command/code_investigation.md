# Code Investigation Report: CLI Command Structure

This report details the findings from analyzing `pyproject.toml` and `cli/main.py` to understand how CLI commands for the `rawr` tool are defined and registered, focusing on identifying commands other than `compile`.

## 1. Entry Point Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)

The `rawr` command's entry point is defined in `pyproject.toml` within the `[project.scripts]` section:

```toml
[project.scripts]
rawr = "cli.main:app" # Line 24
```

This configuration maps the execution of the `rawr` command to the `app` object located in the `cli/main.py` module.

## 2. Command Definition and Registration (`cli/main.py`)

The `cli/main.py` file uses the `typer` library to define and manage CLI subcommands.

*   **Typer Application Initialization:**
    The main Typer application instance is initialized on line 55:
    ```python
    app = typer.Typer(
        name="agent-config-cli",
        help="CLI tool to manage Agent Configurations.", # Updated help text
        add_completion=False,
    ) # Lines 55-59
    ```

*   **`compile` Command Registration:**
    The `compile` subcommand is registered using the `@app.command()` decorator applied to the `compile_agent_config` function:
    ```python
    @app.command("compile") # Line 200
    def compile_agent_config(
        agent_slug: Annotated[
            str,
            typer.Argument(
                help="The unique slug of the agent whose config.yaml should be compiled."
            ),
        ]
    ):
        """
        Loads, validates, and compiles an agent's config.yaml, updating the global registry.
        """
        # ... function implementation ... # Lines 201-309
    ```

*   **Other Commands (Commented Out):**
    The analysis revealed that the definitions and registrations for commands other than `compile` (`add`, `update`, `delete`) are currently **commented out** in `cli/main.py`. These sections are the ones that would need to be permanently removed or ensured they remain commented out to achieve the goal of having only the `compile` command.

    *   **`add` command:** Lines 91-120 (Decorator `@app.command(constants.CMD_ADD)` on line 91 is commented out).
    *   **`update` command:** Lines 123-165 (Decorator `@app.command(constants.CMD_UPDATE)` on line 123 is commented out).
    *   **`delete` command:** Lines 168-197 (Decorator `@app.command(constants.CMD_DELETE)` on line 168 is commented out).

## Conclusion

The `rawr` CLI tool is configured via `pyproject.toml` to use the `app` object in `cli/main.py`. This `app` object is a Typer application. Subcommands are registered using the `@app.command()` decorator. Currently, only the `compile` command is actively registered. The code sections previously responsible for the `add`, `update`, and `delete` commands are present but commented out (Lines 91-197).
