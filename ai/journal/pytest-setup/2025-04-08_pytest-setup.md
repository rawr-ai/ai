# Development Log: Pytest Setup
**Date:** 2025-04-08

## Objective
To integrate the `pytest` testing framework into the project based on the plan outlined in `ai/sessions/2025-04-08/pytest-setup/setup-test-suite-v2.md`.

## Summary of Execution
The Orchestrator agent initiated a workflow to set up `pytest`. Following user feedback, the initial plan was revised to include review and diagramming steps before execution. The revised plan was reviewed by an `analyze` agent and visualized with a Mermaid diagram by a `diagram` agent. Subsequently, the technical steps were executed sequentially by `git`, `code`, `implement`, and `test` agents within a dedicated feature branch (`feature/pytest-setup`). The setup was verified by running `pytest`, which confirmed 2 passing tests. The changes were then committed and merged into the `main` branch. Finally, the standard development logging process was initiated.

## Key Steps Performed:
1.  **Planning & Review:**
    *   Orchestrator proposed an initial workflow plan.
    *   User requested plan review and diagramming.
    *   Orchestrator revised the plan.
    *   `analyze` agent reviewed and approved the core technical steps (3-11) of the revised plan.
    *   `diagram` agent generated a Mermaid sequence diagram of the workflow.
2.  **Git Branching:**
    *   `git` agent created the `feature/pytest-setup` branch from `main`.
3.  **File Creation & Configuration:**
    *   `code` agent created `requirements-dev.txt` with `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-mock`.
    *   `implement` agent created a virtual environment (`venv`) and installed dependencies using `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.
    *   `implement` agent created the `tests/` directory.
    *   `code` agent created `pytest.ini` with basic configuration (`testpaths`, `python_files`, `asyncio_mode`).
    *   `code` agent created `tests/test_example.py` with initial passing sync and async tests.
4.  **Verification:**
    *   `test` agent executed `pytest -v`, confirming 2 tests passed successfully.
5.  **Git Integration:**
    *   `git` agent committed `requirements-dev.txt`, `pytest.ini`, and `tests/` to `feature/pytest-setup`.
    *   `git` agent merged `feature/pytest-setup` into `main`.
6.  **Development Logging Initiated:**
    *   `architect` agent determined the log file path and naming convention (`./ai/journal/pytest-setup/2025-04-08_pytest-setup.md`).
    *   `analyze` agent (this step) generated this log summary based on conversation history.
