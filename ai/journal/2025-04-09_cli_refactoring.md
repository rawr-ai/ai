# Development Log: CLI Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-04-09
**Workflow:** CLI Refactoring

## Task Summary

This log documents the successful completion of the CLI structure refactoring task.

## Goal

The primary goal was to improve the organization, maintainability, and usability of the project's command-line interface tools by consolidating them under a unified structure and entry point.

## Key Changes Implemented

*   **Directory Renaming:** The `scripts/` directory containing various CLI scripts was renamed to `cli/`.
*   **Unified Entry Point:** A single entry point, `cli/main.py`, was established using the Typer library to manage different commands and subcommands.
*   **Logic Consolidation:** Internal logic from previous scripts was refactored and integrated into the new structure under `cli/main.py` or related modules within the `cli/` directory.
*   **Import Updates:** All internal imports referencing the old `scripts/` path were updated to point to the new `cli/` structure.
*   **Test Updates:** All associated tests located in the `tests/` directory were updated to reflect the new CLI structure, entry points, and command invocation methods.

## Outcome

*   The refactoring was successfully completed.
*   The changes were developed on the `refactor/cli-structure` branch.
*   The feature branch was merged into the `main` branch.
*   The `refactor/cli-structure` branch has been deleted post-merge.
*   The project now benefits from a cleaner, more standardized CLI structure.
