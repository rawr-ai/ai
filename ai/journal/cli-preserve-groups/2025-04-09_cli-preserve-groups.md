## 2025-04-09: Plan and Implement --preserve-groups Flag for CLI

**Objective:** Modify the `scripts/agent_config_manager` CLI tool to add a `--preserve-groups` flag to the `update` command, allowing optional preservation of existing group assignments in the target JSON configuration.

**Planning Phase:**
*   Analyzed existing CLI code (`cli.py`, `commands.py`, `config.py`, `models.py`) to understand the update flow and identify modification points.
*   Generated a detailed implementation plan specifying changes to `cli.py` (add argparse flag) and `commands.py` (update function signature and add conditional logic).
*   Saved analysis findings and the implementation plan to `@ai/projects/cli-yaml-config/`.

**Implementation Phase:**
*   Created and checked out the `feature/cli-preserve-groups` branch from `main`.
*   Applied the specified code modifications to `scripts/agent_config_manager/cli.py` and `scripts/agent_config_manager/commands.py`.
*   Performed verification testing using a temporary agent definition:
    *   Confirmed default overwrite behavior (flag *not* used).
    *   Confirmed group preservation behavior (flag *used*).
    *   Confirmed other fields (like `name`) are still updated when groups are preserved.
*   Committed the verified changes to the feature branch with message `feat: Add --preserve-groups flag to CLI update command`.

**Outcome:** The feature was successfully planned, implemented, verified, and committed to the feature branch.
