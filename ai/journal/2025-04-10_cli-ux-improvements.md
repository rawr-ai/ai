# Development Log: CLI UX Improvements

**Date:** 2025-04-10
**Workflow:** CLI UX Improvements (`refactor/cli-ux-improvements`)

## Summary

This log entry summarizes the completion of the CLI refactoring effort aimed at improving user experience and maintainability. The work involved centralizing constants, simplifying CLI invocation, enhancing test coverage, and addressing review feedback.

## Key Changes Implemented

*   **Centralized Constants:** Refactored the CLI application (`cli/`) and associated tests (`tests/`) to use centralized constants defined in `cli/constants.py` and `tests/constants.py`, respectively. This eliminates magic strings and improves code readability and maintainability.
*   **Simplified CLI Invocation:** Configured `pyproject.toml` to define a script entry point, allowing the CLI application to be invoked using a simple `rawr` command alias after installation.
*   **Enhanced Test Coverage:** Added new tests to specifically validate the package installation process and the functionality of the `rawr` entry point.
*   **Addressed Review Feedback:** Updated tests to remove hardcoded mock paths, improving test robustness and maintainability based on code review feedback.
*   **Verification:** Confirmed the stability and correctness of all changes by running the full test suite (`pytest`), which passed successfully.

## Outcome

The `refactor/cli-ux-improvements` feature branch, containing all the above changes, has been successfully implemented, tested, reviewed, fixed, committed, and merged into the `main` branch. The CLI is now easier to invoke and maintain.
