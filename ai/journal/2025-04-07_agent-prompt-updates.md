# Dev Log: Update Agent Prompts for File Output

## Date
2025-04-07

## Branch
`feature/agent-prompt-file-output-directive`

## Summary
*   **Problem:** Agents designed for substantial outputs (reports, docs, diagrams) lacked a standard method for handling them, leading to inefficient passing of large text blocks.
*   **Solution:** Added a standard instruction block to relevant agent prompts, directing them to switch to a file-writing mode (e.g., `code`) to save outputs to a designated file (typically in `ai/journal/`) and return the path instead of the content.

## Details
The workflow involved the following steps:
1.  **Planning & Setup:** Defined the objective, created a detailed workflow plan, reviewed it, and documented it with a Mermaid diagram in `ai/journal/agent-prompt-updates/`. Created the feature branch `feature/agent-prompt-file-output-directive`.
2.  **Agent Identification:** Used an `analyze` agent to scan `agents/` (excluding `orchestrate`, `meta`) and identified 8 agent prompt files needing the update based on their potential for large outputs.
3.  **Modification:** A `code` agent iteratively read each identified prompt, appended the standard "Output Handling for Substantial Content" instruction block, and saved the complete modified content back to the file.
4.  **Verification:** A `review` agent confirmed the instruction block was correctly added to all 8 prompts and that they remained coherent.
5.  **Commit:** A `git` agent staged and committed the 8 modified prompt files and the 2 journal files (plan, diagram) to the feature branch.
6.  **Logging Initiation:** Initiated the standard development logging playbook (`pb_session_journaling.md`).

## Notes
*   The logging path/filename convention was initially misinterpreted based on older playbook info and was corrected by the user during the logging step. The correct convention is `./ai/journal/workflow-name/[YYYY-MM-DD]_[workflow-name].md`.
