# Development Log Entry

**Date:** 2025-04-06
**Task:** Update Orchestrator SOPs and Prompt

**Summary:**

Updated the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the Orchestrator agent and embedded them directly into its core prompt (`agents/orchestrate/orchestrators/orchestrator_generic.md`).

Key changes include:
*   Analyzed principles from playbooks (`pb_development_logging.md`, `pb_discovery_driven_execution.md`, `pb_iterative_execution_verification.md`).
*   Updated `agents/orchestrate/orchestrator_SOPs.md` by adding a "Plan Review" section and incorporating principles like "Define Conventions", "Specify Before Execution", "Verify & Iterate", and "Mode Switching for Content Generation".
*   Integrated the updated SOPs content into the Orchestrator's main prompt file.
*   Submitted the revised SOPs content to the Knowledge Graph under the "Orchestrator Agent" concept.
*   Committed changes to the `feature/update-orchestrator-sops-prompt` branch.

**Commit:** `feat: Update Orchestrator SOPs and embed in prompt`
