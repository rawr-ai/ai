# Development Log: 2025-04-06 - Create Position Coach Agent &amp; Refine Workflow

## Date:
2025-04-06

## Objective:
To create and integrate a new 'Position Coach' agent, specializing in the design, refinement, and configuration of other AI agents, and to refine the development workflow based on the experience.

## Key Steps &amp; Outcomes:
*   **Initial Setup:** Created Git feature branch `feat/position-coach-agent` for isolated development.
*   **Agent Design:** Designed and documented the 'Position Coach' agent's mandate, responsibilities, and persona in `agents/design/position_coach_agent.md`.
*   **Successful Integration:** Following research, correctly integrated the agent by adding a concise entry to `.roomodes` and detailed configuration to `roo_agent_mode_config.md`.
*   **Verification:** Confirmed system recognition of the new agent.
*   **Commits (Feature Branch):** Committed agent creation and configuration changes to the `feat/position-coach-agent` branch.
*   **Merge:** Successfully merged `feat/position-coach-agent` into the `main` branch.
*   **New Playbook Creation:** Conceptualized and created the 'Discovery Driven Execution' playbook in `ai/playbooks/pb_discovery_driven_execution.md`.
*   **Final Commits (Main Branch):** Committed the new playbook and any related documentation updates to the `main` branch.

## Significant Learnings/Deviations:
*   **Initial Failure:** An attempt to register the agent by directly modifying only the `.roomodes` file failed due to an incorrect understanding of the configuration process, specifically the necessity of the `roo_agent_mode_config.md` file for detailed definitions.
*   **Workflow Shift:** The failure prompted a shift to research using the 'Analyze' mode to investigate the established conventions for adding new agents by examining both `.roomodes` and `roo_agent_mode_config.md`.
*   **Process Improvement:** The experience highlighted the importance of understanding system conventions before attempting modifications, leading to the evaluation of existing playbooks and the creation of the 'Discovery Driven Execution' playbook to formalize a research-first approach when dealing with unfamiliar system aspects.
