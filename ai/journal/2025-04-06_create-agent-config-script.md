# DevLog Entry: Create Agent Configuration Management Script

**Date:** 2025-04-06
**Playbook:** `ai/playbooks/pb_session_journaling.md` (Steps 2 & 3)

## Task Summary

**Objective:** Develop a Python script (`scripts/manage_agent_configs.py`) to automate the creation, update, and deletion of agent configurations stored in a central JSON file (e.g., `ai/graph/plays/custom_modes.json`) based on definitions found in Markdown files (`*.md`). This aims to streamline agent configuration management and ensure consistency between Markdown documentation and the active configuration.

## Key Activities & Iterations

1.  **Branching & Setup:**
    *   Created feature branch `feat/agent-config-script` from `main` to isolate development.

2.  **Convention Definition:**
    *   Established conventions for defining agent configurations within Markdown files using specific code fences (e.g., ```json {agent-config="<agent_slug>"}```).
    *   Documented these conventions, including required fields (slug, name, role) and structure, in `docs/agent_config_conventions.md`.

3.  **Initial Implementation (Python/Pydantic):**
    *   Developed the core script logic using Python.
    *   Utilized Pydantic for defining the `AgentConfig` model and validating data extracted from Markdown.
    *   Implemented functions for:
        *   Scanning specified directories for Markdown files.
        *   Parsing Markdown content to find agent configuration code blocks.
        *   Loading and validating the JSON data within these blocks against the Pydantic model.
        *   Reading the target JSON configuration file.
        *   Performing add, update, or delete operations on the target JSON based on script arguments and discovered configurations.
        *   Writing the updated configuration back to the target JSON file.

4.  **Review & Refinement (Iteration 1):**
    *   Incorporated feedback from code review.
    *   Refactored the Markdown parsing logic for improved robustness and clarity.
    *   Enhanced error handling for scenarios like invalid JSON in Markdown or missing required fields.
    *   Added more informative logging messages to track script execution and potential issues.
    *   Corrected logic for handling the nested structure within the target JSON file (assuming configurations are stored under a specific key).

5.  **Testing & Refinement (Iteration 2):**
    *   Performed manual testing covering primary use cases:
        *   Adding a new agent configuration from a Markdown file.
        *   Updating an existing agent configuration.
        *   Deleting an agent configuration (simulated by removing the block from Markdown and re-running).
        *   Handling edge cases like Markdown files without config blocks, invalid JSON syntax, and missing files.
    *   Identified and fixed a bug related to adding the first configuration when the target JSON file did not initially exist or was empty. Ensured the script correctly initializes the file structure.

6.  **Merge & Completion:**
    *   Verified the script functioned as expected after refinements.
    *   Successfully merged the `feat/agent-config-script` branch back into `main`.

## Outcome

*   A functional and tested Python script (`scripts/manage_agent_configs.py`) is available for managing agent configurations derived from Markdown files.
*   Clear conventions for defining these configurations are documented in `docs/agent_config_conventions.md`.
*   The script provides an automated way to keep the central agent configuration JSON synchronized with the definitions documented in Markdown, reducing manual effort and the risk of inconsistencies.

## Key Artifacts

*   **Script:** `scripts/manage_agent_configs.py`
*   **Conventions:** `docs/agent_config_conventions.md`
*   **Target Configuration File (Managed by Script):** `ai/graph/plays/custom_modes.json` (or similar, as configured within the script)
