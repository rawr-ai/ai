# Agent System Architecture: The Football Team

## 1. Introduction & Metaphor

This document outlines the proposed architecture for the multi-agent system, using the metaphor of an American Football team's coaching and management staff. This structure aims to provide clear roles, responsibilities, and interaction patterns.

The core idea is that different specialized agents (like coordinators) manage specific domains (offense, defense, special teams) under the guidance of a Head Coach and General Manager, ensuring cohesive strategy and execution.

## 2. Defined Roles & Responsibilities

### 2.1. General Manager (GM)
- **Purpose:** Oversees the entire "franchise," focusing on long-term strategy, resource allocation (agent capabilities, knowledge sources), and overall system health. Sets high-level goals and evaluates performance.
- **Detailed Definition:** See `agents/orchestrate/concepts/agent_general-manager.md`

### 2.2. Head Coach (HC)
- **Purpose:** Responsible for the overall game plan (task execution strategy), coordinating the efforts of the specialized coordinators, making real-time tactical decisions, and managing the flow of information between agents.
- **Detailed Definition:** See `agents/orchestrate/concepts/agent_head-coach.md`

### 2.3. Coordinators
    - **Purpose:** Specialized agents responsible for managing specific sub-domains or phases of a task. They develop detailed plans within their domain based on the HC's strategy and direct the "player" agents executing the work.
    - **2.3.1. Offensive Coordinator (OC):** Manages agents and strategies related to "advancing the ball" – generating content, writing code, achieving primary task objectives.
        - **Detailed Definition:** See `agents/orchestrate/concepts/agent_offensive-coordinator.md`
    - **2.3.2. Defensive Coordinator (DC):** Manages agents and strategies related to "preventing setbacks" – quality control, validation, error handling, security checks, reviewing outputs.
        - **Detailed Definition:** See `agents/orchestrate/concepts/agent_defensive-coordinator.md`
    - **2.3.3. Special Teams Coordinator (STC):** Manages agents and strategies for specialized, often transitional tasks – data ingestion/formatting, tool use orchestration, environment setup, deployment, specific communication protocols.
        - **Detailed Definition:** See `agents/orchestrate/concepts/agent_special-teams-coordinator.md`

### 2.4. Head Trainer / Medical Staff
- **Purpose:** Monitors agent performance, system health, resource usage (like API calls, tokens), identifies bottlenecks, and handles error recovery or agent "rehabilitation." Ensures agents are "fit" to perform.
- **Detailed Definition:** See `agents/orchestrate/concepts/agent_head-trainer.md`

## 3. Undefined or Missing Roles (Gaps Identified)

Based on the analysis of existing concepts and feedback, the following roles or functions need further definition or assignment:

- **Player Agents:** While implied, the specific agents executing tasks under the coordinators (e.g., a "Code Writer" agent under the OC, a "Tester" agent under the DC) are not explicitly defined as distinct roles within this architectural level. Their capabilities are currently embedded within the coordinator descriptions or assumed.
- **Scouting / Intelligence:** No dedicated role for analyzing incoming tasks, understanding user intent deeply, or gathering external context beyond what's immediately provided. This might be partially covered by HC/GM or require a new role.
- **Rules Official / Compliance:** No explicit role for ensuring adherence to constraints, ethical guidelines, or external regulations beyond the general quality checks potentially done by the DC.
- **Communication Facilitator:** While the HC coordinates, there isn't a specific role dedicated *solely* to managing the syntax, semantics, and protocols of inter-agent communication, which could become complex.

## 4. Interaction Patterns & Workflow

*(This section needs further development based on specific use cases, but the general flow involves the GM setting goals, the HC creating a game plan, Coordinators executing phases of the plan using player agents, and the Head Trainer monitoring health.)*

## 5. The Playbook Concept

- **Purpose:** Represents reusable strategies, sequences of actions, or workflows for common tasks or scenarios.
- **Structure:** Playbooks would be defined for Offense, Defense, and Special Teams, corresponding to the coordinator roles.
- **Example:** An "Offensive Playbook" might contain plays for "Generate API Client Code," while a "Defensive Playbook" could have plays for "Perform Security Audit."
- **Location:** Stored in `agents/orchestrate/playbooks/{offense|defense|special}/`

## 6. Conclusion & Next Steps

This architecture provides a foundational structure. Next steps include:
- Refining interaction patterns and communication protocols.
- Explicitly defining "Player" agent roles and capabilities.
- Addressing the identified gaps (Scouting, Compliance, etc.).
- Developing initial Playbooks for core tasks.
