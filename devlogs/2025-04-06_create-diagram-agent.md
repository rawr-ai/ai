# Development Log Entry

**Date:** 2025-04-06
**Workflow:** `create-diagram-agent`

## Summary/Objective
The primary goal of this workflow was to establish a new "Diagram" agent capability within the system and integrate a diagramming step into the standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the Orchestrator agent.

## Key Changes/Steps

1.  **Planning & Setup:**
    *   A workflow plan for creating the Diagram agent and updating SOPs was proposed and reviewed.
    *   A dedicated feature branch, `feat/create-diagram-agent`, was created for development.
2.  **Agent Definition:**
    *   An existing Diagram agent definition was discovered at `agents/architect/agent_diagram.md`.
    *   Based on user direction, the decision was made to keep the agent definition file in its original location, skipping the planned move step.
    *   The existing `agents/architect/agent_diagram.md` file was committed to the `feat/create-diagram-agent` branch.
3.  **Orchestrator SOP Update:**
    *   The Orchestrator SOPs file (`agents/orchestrate/orchestrator_SOPs.md`) was read.
    *   Necessary changes to incorporate the diagramming step were defined.
    *   The `agents/orchestrate/orchestrator_SOPs.md` file was updated with the new step.
    *   The updated SOPs file was committed to the `feat/create-diagram-agent` branch.
4.  **Integration:**
    *   The `feat/create-diagram-agent` branch, containing the agent definition reference and updated SOPs, was successfully merged into the `main` branch.

## Outcome
The workflow successfully integrated the concept of a Diagram agent and updated the Orchestrator SOPs to include a diagramming step. An existing agent definition file was leveraged, and all changes were merged into the main codebase.
