# Development Log Entry

**Date:** 2025-04-06

**Task Description:** Create 'Entry' Knowledge Graph Entity

**Detailed Summary:**
The objective was to create a generic 'Entry' entity for the Knowledge Graph, intended to represent various types of log entries or records. The development process involved several key steps:

1.  **Research:** Initial investigation was conducted to understand the requirements and potential structure for a generic entry entity within the project's knowledge graph framework.
2.  **Schema Design:** The schema for the 'Entry' entity was designed. A significant decision during this phase was to adopt the project's established convention of using Pydantic models for defining Knowledge Graph entities. This ensures consistency and leverages existing patterns within the codebase.
3.  **Implementation:** The designed schema was implemented in Python using Pydantic, resulting in the creation of the `ai/graph/entities/Entry.py` file.
4.  **Verification:** The newly created `Entry.py` file and its defined entity structure were reviewed and verified to ensure correctness and adherence to the design requirements and project standards.

The final outcome was the successful creation and verification of the `ai/graph/entities/Entry.py` file, establishing the 'Entry' entity within the knowledge graph system according to the project's Pydantic-based conventions.

**Key Steps Taken:**
1.  **Research:** Investigated requirements and structure for a generic entry entity.
2.  **Schema Design:** Designed the 'Entry' entity schema, deciding to use Pydantic models.
3.  **Implementation:** Implemented the schema in `ai/graph/entities/Entry.py` using Pydantic.
4.  **Verification:** Reviewed and verified the `Entry.py` file and entity structure.

**Key Decisions/Findings:**
*   Adopted the project's established convention of using Pydantic models for defining Knowledge Graph entities to ensure consistency.

**Affected Files:**
*   `ai/graph/entities/Entry.py`
