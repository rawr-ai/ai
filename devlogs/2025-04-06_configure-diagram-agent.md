# Development Log Entry

**Date:** 2025-04-06
**Workflow:** configure-diagram-agent
**File:** `devlogs/2025-04-06_configure-diagram-agent.md`

## Summary/Objective
The primary goal of this workflow was to integrate the Diagram agent into the system. This involved updating the Orchestrator prompt (`orchestrator_generic.md`) with diagramming Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), adding the Diagram agent configuration to `custom_modes.json`, verifying the agent's functionality by generating a workflow diagram, and merging all related changes into the main branch.

## Key Changes/Steps
1.  **Planning:** Workflow plan `configure-diagram-agent-and-update-orchestrator-v5` was approved after several revisions addressing feedback on JSON handling, task granularity, and Git branch management.
2.  **Orchestrator Prompt Update:** A sub-workflow was delegated to update `agents/orchestrate/orchestrators/orchestrator_generic.md` with diagramming SOPs. Changes were committed to the `feat/configure-diagram-agent-v3` branch.
3.  **`custom_modes.json` Update:** A sub-workflow generated manual instructions for updating the `custom_modes.json` file to include the Diagram agent configuration.
4.  **Manual Configuration & Confirmation:** The user manually updated `custom_modes.json` using the generated instructions and confirmed that the Diagram agent mode was functional.
5.  **Diagram Generation:** The newly configured Diagram agent was used to generate a Mermaid diagram representing the entire workflow.
6.  **Diagram File Creation & Commit:** The generated diagram was saved to `ai/graph/plays/configure-diagram-agent-and-update-orchestrator-v5/full_workflow_diagram.mmd` and committed to the `feat/configure-diagram-agent-v3` branch.
7.  **Merge:** The feature branch `feat/configure-diagram-agent-v3`, containing all updates and the new diagram, was successfully merged into the `main` branch.

## Outcome
The Diagram agent is now successfully configured and integrated into the system. The Orchestrator prompt includes relevant SOPs, and the `custom_modes.json` file reflects the new agent configuration. A visual diagram of the workflow has been generated and stored in the project repository. All changes have been integrated into the main codebase.
