[pytest]
# Only collect smoke tests located in the lightweight test suite.
# This prevents pytest from traversing large numbers of low-level or
# legacy tests that are no longer providing enough value and slow the
# feedback loop down considerably.
#
# If you need to re-enable the full suite simply remove the --ignore
# arguments or point `testpaths` back at `tests`.

# Paths to search for tests
testpaths = tests

# Tell pytest to completely ignore the heavier, low-level test buckets.
# We keep them in the repository for now so that any useful snippets can
# still be referenced during future refactors, but they are no longer
# executed as part of the default CI run.
# Multi-line values in *pytest.ini* must be indented instead of escaped with
# backslashes; using backslashes breaks the config parser and results in *no*
# tests being collected.  We therefore list the ``addopts`` flags on
# subsequent indented lines.
